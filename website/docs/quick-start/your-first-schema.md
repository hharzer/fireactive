## Why use a `Schema`?

The [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) is great because it:

- syncs data between devices in realtime, no HTTP requests needed;
- can be used directly in client-side code, no backend server needed; and
- enables offline persistence in the absence of a connection.

Using a Fireactive means the following additional benefits:

1. Predictable data with an explicit model-based [structure for your NoSQL database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data);
2. Code autocomplete and type-checking with VS Code and/or TypeScript; and
3. Easier APIs for syncing and updates to and from your Realtime Database.
